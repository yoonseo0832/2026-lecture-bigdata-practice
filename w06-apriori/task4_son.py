"""Week 6 · Task 4 (optional) — SON: A-Priori that survives being split up.

Textbook §6.4.3 (the SON algorithm) and §6.4.4 (SON and MapReduce).

Tasks 1 and 3 both assume the baskets fit on one machine. SON does not. It is
the textbook's own answer to "what if they do not", it is two passes, and it has
a guarantee that most sampling schemes do not:

    an itemset that is frequent overall is frequent in at least one chunk

which is why pass one can look at chunks independently and still miss nothing.
Proving that to yourself is worth more than the code.

    python3 task4_son.py                 # your SON, single process
    python3 task4_son.py --spark         # the same, as a real MapReduce job

Optional. Not part of the assignment.

    how you lose the guarantee.
